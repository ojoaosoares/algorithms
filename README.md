# Algorithms Repository

This folder serves as a repository for various algorithms implemented in different programming languages. Each file represents a specific algorithm or problem-solving approach.

## Project Structure

- The source code is organized in this main directory.
- Each algorithm or problem-solving exercise has its own file for clarity and ease of navigation.

## Technologies Used

The algorithms are implemented in various programming languages, including but not limited to:
- C  
- C++

## Usage

Feel free to explore the files to understand the logic and implementation of different algorithms. You can use them as a reference or incorporate them into your projects as needed.
